# Not my own site but someone else's I am using for funzies!


This is the repo for my personal website 👋

## Develop locally
If you wish to run this site locally, clone it, and run:

`npm install`
`npm start`

This will create a local server at `http://localhost:3000` with Browsersync and auto-refresh.
